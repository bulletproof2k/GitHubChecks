Display GitHub CI build status in Sublime Text. 

The badge: `Build #âœ“#x(#)` where `x` is the number of successful builds, `y` is the number of failures + errors (if any) and `z` is the number of pendings.


## Installation

GitHubBuildStatus is available to be installed via Package Control.

# on Linux
cd $HOME/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages
# on Windows (PowerShell)
cd "$env:appdata\Sublime Text 3\Packages\"

git clone git@github.com/randy3k/GitHubBuildStatus.git

## Settings

You are also recommended to provide your own [github api token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) to allow more frequent refreshes and access to your private repos. Simply run `Preference: GitHub Build Status` and edit the `token` setting.
